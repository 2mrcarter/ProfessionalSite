                <p>My love for technology has always existed, but initially I chose a different path.  Over the last 15 years, I've had the opportunity to work in a variety of client-facing roles. My unique professional background has equipped me with the business acumen necessary to manage several tasks harmoniously, all while building and maintaining professional relationships throughout the sales and project cycle. I believe that this experience gives me special insight into what my client needs are.
                </p>
                <p>Today I am very happy to be a Software Developer.  With extensive experiences within project management, logistics management, budget analysis, and planning; I aim to not only create unique designs for each client, but to do so while also providing a pleasing experience they will not forget.  I'm happy in my career.  I'd be even happier to create something extraodinary with you.
